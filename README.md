# FactCheckExplorer Python Library üìö

The FactCheckExplorer library provides an easy-to-use Python interface for querying and fetching fact-checking data from Google's Fact Check Explorer tool. This library bypasses the typical front-end limitations, allowing users to retrieve an extensive range of fact-checked claims based on their search criteria.

## Features üåü

- **Customizable Queries**:  Execute searches using specific keywords, with the ability to filter results by language using standard language codes (e.g., "en" for English, "es" for Spanish).
- **Extended Results**: Bypass the typical limits to fetch up to 10,000 results, providing more comprehensive datasets for analysis.
- **Data Extraction**: Parse the fetched data automatically into structured information for ease of use.
- **CSV Export**: Directly convert and save the data into a CSV file for offline analysis or archiving.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

You can install the FactCheckExplorer library directly from GitHub. Ensure you have `git` and `pip` installed on your machine, then run the following command:

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/GONZOsint/factcheckexplorer.git
